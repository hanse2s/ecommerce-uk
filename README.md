Queries and descriptive statistics for e-commerce data in the United Kingdom

We can learn a lot from basic transaction data. In this project, I run basic and advanced queries, calculate various descriptive statistics, and build simple data visualizations to explore trends in sales for an e-commerce business located in the United Kingdom. Using the information gained, I recommend specific marketing strategies to target subsets of customers based on their spending.
